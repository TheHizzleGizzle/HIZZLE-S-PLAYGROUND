# Implementation Status

## Completed ?

### Project Setup
- ? Electron + React + TypeScript project structure
- ? Webpack configuration for web and desktop builds
- ? TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- ? Package.json with all dependencies

### Core Game Systems
- ? Phaser 3 game engine integration
- ? Basic scene structure (MenuScene, WorldScene, BattleScene, BreedingScene)
- ? Creature data model with stats and abilities
- ? Ability data model with code storage (blocks + text)
- ? Redux store with gameSlice, battleSlice, editorSlice
- ? Battle engine with turn-based combat
- ? Breeding engine with genetic code inheritance
- ? World generator for procedural world creation

### Code Editor
- ? Blockly visual block editor setup
- ? Monaco Editor text editor setup
- ? Dual editor container with mode switching
- ? Code synchronization between blocks and text
- ? Custom block definitions (damage, heal, buff, get_self, get_enemy, get_stat)
- ? Python-like code generation from blocks
- ? Code validator with safety checks
- ? Code executor with sandboxed execution

### Utilities
- ? Sprite loader (placeholder sprites)
- ? Safe code execution utilities
- ? Creature templates

## In Progress / Partial ??

### World System
- ?? Basic tilemap rendering (placeholder)
- ?? Player movement (implemented but needs sprites)
- ? Creature encounter system
- ? NPC system
- ? Resource collection

### Battle System
- ?? Basic battle scene (visual only)
- ? Battle engine logic (complete)
- ? Battle UI components
- ? Ability selection interface
- ? Visual feedback for code execution

### Breeding System
- ?? Basic breeding scene (placeholder)
- ? Breeding engine logic (complete)
- ? Breeding UI
- ? Parent selection interface

### Code Editor
- ? Core functionality complete
- ? Advanced block types (loops, conditionals)
- ? Code templates for beginners
- ? Tutorial system integration

## Not Started ?

### Assets
- ? Minecraft-style creature sprites
- ? World tile sprites
- ? UI elements
- ? Sound effects and music

### Gameplay Features
- ? Creature catching system
- ? Creature leveling and experience
- ? Inventory system (partially implemented in Redux)
- ? Save/load system
- ? Tutorial progression system
- ? Unlock system for code functions and areas

### Polish
- ? Animations
- ? Visual effects
- ? Sound system
- ? Performance optimization
- ? Error handling improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Create placeholder sprites** - Generate simple blocky sprites for creatures and tiles
2. **Implement battle UI** - Create React components for battle interface
3. **Complete world system** - Integrate WorldGenerator with WorldScene
4. **Add creature catching** - Implement encounter and capture mechanics
5. **Create tutorial system** - Build progressive tutorial with code examples
6. **Add save/load** - Implement persistence for game state
7. **Polish and test** - Add animations, effects, and comprehensive testing

## Technical Notes

### Code Execution
- Currently uses simplified Python-to-JS conversion
- For production, consider using Brython or Skulpt for proper Python execution
- Sandbox includes timeout protection and API whitelisting

### Sprite System
- Currently uses placeholder sprites generated via Phaser graphics
- Production should use actual sprite images in Minecraft-style

### Build System
- Webpack configured for both web and Electron
- Monaco Editor requires special handling (fonts, workers)
- Consider adding Monaco webpack plugin for better integration

## Known Issues

1. Monaco Editor may need additional webpack configuration for workers
2. Blockly-to-code conversion is simplified - may need AST parser for production
3. Code-to-block conversion not fully implemented
4. Battle scene needs React UI integration
5. Missing actual sprite assets
